### Hooks
**What is Hook?**

Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components.

**Why Hooks?**

Because for example there is no way to attache reusable behavior to a component. Render props and HOC patterns try to solve this (“wrapper hell”), but this require to restructure components to use them.

- "ahead-of-time-compilation" is the future and class components don't play well with it. 

- "Classes confuse both people and machines"
