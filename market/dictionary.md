### What Is SEC Form 13F?
13F is quarterly report that is required to be filed by all institutional investment managers with at least $100 million in assets under management.

Congress created the 13F requirement in 1975. Its intention was to provide the U.S. public a view of the holdings of the nation's largest institutional investors. Lawmakers believed this would increase investor confidence in the integrity of the nation's financial markets. Firms that are considered institutional investment managers include 
- mutual funds, 
- hedge funds, 
- trust companies, 
- pension funds,
- insurance companies, 
- and registered investment advisors.

> If it's February 15, May 15, August 15, or November 15 of any given year, then it's 13F day.
