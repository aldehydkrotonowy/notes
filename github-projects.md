- **Mixins** - In object-oriented programming languages, a mixin (or mix-in) is a class that contains methods for use by other classes without having to be the parent class of those other classes. How those other classes gain access to the mixin's methods depends on the language. Mixins are sometimes described as being "included" rather than "inherited".
- **Trait** - In computer programming, a trait is a concept used in object-oriented programming, which represents a set of methods that can be used to extend the functionality of a class

	- "Traits are a feature used by most modern languages to implement polymorphism without relying on inheritance."

- **Role-oriented programming** - as a form of computer programming aims at expressing things in terms that are analogous to human conceptual understanding of the World. This should make programs easier to understand and maintain. Approaches: **Traits** and **Mixins**

"JavaScript natively supports various function based implementations of Role approaches like Traits and Mixins. Such a function defines additional behavior by at least one method bound to the this6 keyword within its function7 body. A Role then has to be delegated explicitly via call8 or apply9 to objects that are in need of additional behavior that is not shared via the prototype chain10."

"JavaScript is a prototypal, duck typed language"
